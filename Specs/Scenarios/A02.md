# A02: Clubs

You must create two components (Query and CRUD) based on the following database tables. You will create the entities by using reverse engineering.

![ERD for A02](./A02.png)

## Query

> **Clubs by Active Status** - Search with Tabular Results

Display the results of looking up Clubs by their active status (active/non-active). Display the employee full name or "No Staff member" for the employee. Follow the mock-up below as a guide to displaying the results. This mock-up demonstrates pagination. Remember you may also use tabular scrolling to limit the number of lines displayed.

**Future Deliverable Implementation Note**: Each club line will contain a link to allow for record maintenance. This link will cause your CRUD component to appear. Add a separate New button to have your CRUD appear.

## CRUD

> **Clubs** - Single Item Create/Read/Update/Deactivate (Delete)

Note the following:

- `Club` entries are **not** deleted. Rather than providing a "delete" button, inlude a "Deactivate" button and in the BLL method, change the `Active` flag to `false` and update the database for that entry. Provide a second button to reactivate a deactivated club. Reactivation will change the `Active` flag to `true` and update the database for that entry.
- For entering the employee id of available staff, use an `<select>`. The select list is based the results of a query returning only employees who are instructors, office administrator or technical support.
